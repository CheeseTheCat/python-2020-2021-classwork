Question 2 Printing
Which of the following would print the string "Hello World"?
1 print("Hello World")
2 print "Hello World"
3 print(Hello World)
4 None of the Above
1
print("Hello World") would correctly display "Hello World".
Question 3 Data Types
If x = 3 What data type would x be?
1 Integer
2 Boolean
3 Float
4 String
1
x would be an Integer.
Question 4 Printing
Which of the following correctly concatenates two different strings in a print statment?

2 Print("THIS","IS","THE","WRONG","ANSWER")
3 print(Hello + World)
4 PRINT("Hello " + "World")
1
Option 1 would be correct due to not haveing a syntax error.
Question 5 Lists & Tuples
Which of the following correctly assigns a variable to a list? NOT a tuple.
1 list1 = ["Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"]
2 list2 = "Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"
3 list3 = ("Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3")
4 None of these are lists
1
Option 1 would correctly assign a variable to a list.
Question 6 Lists & Tuples
Which of the following correctly assigns a variable to a tuple? NOT a list.
1 tuple1 = ("Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3")
2 tuple2 = "Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"
3 tuple3 = ["Thing 1","Thing 2","Thing 3"]
4 None of these are tuples
1
Option 1 would correctly assign a variable to a tuple.
Question 7 If statments
When useing If statments how do you specify specific code to run if it is true?
1 You indent the code you want to run
2 You capitalize the code
3 You you indent the first line only
4 None of these are correct
1
Option 1 would be correct because after the If statment the following code you want to run would be indented.
Question 8 Spacing
How many spaces is the standard indent in our classroom?
1 4 spaces
2 2 spaces
3 6 spaces
4 3 spaces
1
We indent our code with four spaces
Question 9 Boolean Operators

Which one of these is a valid variable?
1 pizza
2 print
3 for
4 valid variable
1
pizza is a valid variable it does not have a space and is not already used by python, it also tastes good.
Question 11 Special Characters
Should you put special characters directly into your code? (Infinity, Omega, Copywrite symbols, ect..)
1 No
2 Yes
3 when nameing a variable
4 when creating a class
1
You should not put special characters into your code because python would not recognize them.
Question 12 Functions
What is a Function?
1 A block of code you can use later in your program
2 A series of mathmaticle operations to get a specific output
3 Some language arts thing you don't know about
4 None of the Above
1
Functions are blocks of code that can be use later in your program.
Question 13 History
What was python named after
1 Monty Python
2 The Snake Python

1
The programming language Python was named afer Monty Python
Question 14 Uses

Question 15 Functions
Is this function created correctly? make_pizza():
1 Yes its fine other than contents
2 No it will have a sintax error
3 No that is a variable
4 None of the Above

2 Yes your missing a Quote
3 No this code is fine
4 No but there is a logical error
1

Question 17 Bugs
Is there a logical error in this code? if 1 < 0:
1 Yes have you ever taken math?
2 No nothing is wrong
3 No but there is a syntax error
4 None of the Above
1
well obvioulsy 1 is alwas greater than 0 so there is a logical error in the code.
Question 18 Learning

1 Yes its simpler than other languages and easier to read
2 No its the most complicated language in the world
3 Python is a programming language?
